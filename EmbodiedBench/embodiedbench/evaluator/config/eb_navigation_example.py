Human Instruction : Navigate to the floorlamp and be as close as possible.

Reasoning and reflection: I can see the floorlmap is at left side in front of me, next to the TVStand. Around me is a Cabinet at my left side. Following the guideline, since the floorlamp is at left side, I can approach it\
by a series of moving forward and left/rightward. Since currently there is an obstacle at my left, I will first move forward twice.
Executable plans: [[0, Move forward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25]]

Environment Feedback: Step 1 is executed successfully; Step 2 is executed successfully;

Reasoning and reflection: I can see now I get closer to the floorlamp. It is still located in front of me at the left. I will try move forward and move leftward in series.
Executable plans: [[0, Move forward by 0.25], [3, Move leftward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25], [3, Move leftward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25]]

Environment Feedback: Step 3 is executed successfully; Step 4 is executed successfully; Step 5 is executed successfully; Step 6 is executed successfully; Step 7 is Invalid, as a StandardIslandHeight is blocking you from moving forward.

Reasoning and reflection: I am a lot closer to the floorlamp by a series a forward and leftward movement. It is still in front of me. However, The last action is invalid, showing that I am blocked from moving forward.\
That means there is an obstacle in front of me and I can see it is probably a small table. Following the strategy, I can get away by first moving to the left and move forward. 
Executable plans: [[3, Move leftward by 0.25], [3, Move leftward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25]]

Environment Feedback: Step 8 is executed successfully; Step 9 is executed successfully; Step 10 is executed successfully; Step 11 is executed successfully;

Reasoning and reflection: I can see that the floorlamp is at the right side of me, slight in the front. I think it in effect of consecutively moving leftward. Also, I have got away with the obstacle.\
Now I need to move right and I will probably be close to the floorlamp.
Executable plans: [[2, Move rightward by 0.25], [2, Move rightward by 0.25]]]

Environment Feedback: Step 12 is executed successfully; Step 13 is executed successfully. 

Reasoning and reflection: Last two action brought me closer to the floorlamp, however, following the strategy, I should not complete now since I can still be closer to the floorlamp by moving forward a few steps.
Executable plans: [[0, Move forward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25]]

Environment Feedback: Step 14 is executed successfully; Step 15 is executed successfully; Step 16 is executed successfully.

Human Instruction: Navigate to the computer on the desk and be as close as possible.

Reasoning and reflection: According to your instruction, I first need to locate the target object. I can see that the computer is located in my left front direction, placed on a desk. Next, I analyze the obstacles around me. In front of me, slightly to the right, there is a chair blocking my direct path. To avoid it, I decide to move leftward first, followed by a forward movement to approach the desk.
Executable plans: [[0, Move forward by 0.25], [3, Move leftward by 0.25]]

Environment Feedback: Step 1 is executed successfully; Step 2 is Invalid, as a StandardHeightTable is blocking you from moving forward.

Reasoning and reflection: I am now closer to the desk, and I can still see the computer on it. It remains in my left front direction. My last leftward movement failed because a StandardHeightTable is blocking my path. However, following the strategy, \
I need not address the invalid action since forward movement can still bring me closer to the target object. So I will still make forward movements for now. 
Executable plans: [[0, Move forward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25]]

Environment Feedback: Step 3 is executed successfully; Step 4 is executed successfully; Step 5 is Invalid, as a StandardHeightTable is blocking you from moving forward.

Reasoning and reflection: I can see that I am getting closer but the last forward move is blocked. Following the strategy, I need to address the invalid action now since it is an obstacle blocking from moving closer in the direction of target object. The computer is at my left side in the front, \
to bypass this obstacle, I plan to first move leftward again to create more space, then try moving forward once more to get closer to the desk and the computer.
Executable plans: [[3, Move leftward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25]]

Environment Feedback: Step 6 is executed successfully; Step 7 is invalid because the StandardHeight is blocking the movement.

Reasoning and reflection: I can see that the computer is still in my left front direction. However, the chair continues to block my path. From the environment feedback, I observed that while my leftward movement was successful, my forward movement was still blocked. This indicates that I didnâ€™t move far enough left to fully bypass the obstacle. To address this, I decide to move leftward two more times to ensure a clear path, then try moving forward again.
Executable plans: [[3, Move leftward by 0.25], [3, Move leftward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25]]

Environment Feedback: Step 8 is executed successfully; Step 9 is executed successfully; Step 10 is executed successfully.

Reasoning and reflection: Now, I can see that the computer has shifted to my right front direction. There are no longer any visible obstacles blocking my way. I deduce that the computer is now to my right because my previous leftward movements adjusted my position significantly to clear the earlier obstacle. Since the path is clear, I plan to approach the computer by moving forward three times and then rightward once to align myself next to it.
Executable plans: [[0, Move forward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25], [2, Move rightward by 0.25]]

Environment Feedback: Step 11 is executed successfully; Step 12 is executed successfully; Step 13 is executed successfully; Step 14 is executed successfully.

Human Instruction: Navigate to the book and be as close as possible.

Reasoning and reflection: At the moment, I cannot see the book in my current field of view. According to the strategy you provided, I will rotate my view ninety degrees at a time until I locate the target object. Since rotation changes my vision, I will not plan any other actions until the book is visible.
Executable plans: [[4, Rotate to the right by 90 degrees]]

Environment Feedback: Step 1 is executed successfully. The book is still not visible in my current field of view.

Reasoning and reflection: I still cannot see the book in my current field of view. Following your instruction, I will rotate ninety degrees again. As the rotation may change my view, I will not plan any additional actions until I locate the book.
Executable plans: [[4, Rotate to the right by 90 degrees]]

Environment Feedback: Step 2 is executed successfully. The book is now visible directly in front of me, placed on a shelf.

Reasoning and reflection: I have located the target object. The book is directly in front of me on a shelf. Following the strategy you provided, I will stop rotating now and start planning my navigation to get close to the book. Since the book is in front of me, I will first move two steps to the right to adjust my position, and then move forward three steps to approach it.
Executable plans: [[2, Move rightward by 0.25], [2, Move rightward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25]]

Environment Feedback: Step 3 to Step 7 are all executed successfully.

Reasoning and reflection: I can now see that the book is directly in front of me, but I have not yet moved close enough to it. According to the standard, I should move closer to the book. Therefore, I decide to move forward three more times to reach the desired position.
Executable plans: [[0, Move forward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25], [0, Move forward by 0.25]]

Environment Feedback: Step 8, Step 9, and Step 10 are all executed successfully.
